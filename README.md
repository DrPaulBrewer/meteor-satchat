meteor-satchat
==============

Meteor chat room app for ham radio satellite enthusiasts.

Beta version provides basic chat room and satellite location display.

This app is written in the [Meteor Javascript framework](http://www.meteor.com)

Contributions of code for features and patches are appreciated and will be mentioned in the CREDITS.

Satellite prediction calculations are done in the browser, based on West's PredictLib, a rewrite of KB2BD's PREDICT from C into Javascript. 

TLEs are updated automatically. The end user does not have to mess around with TLEs manually.

version 0.5.0 uses the [John Magliacane's KD2BD Predict](http://www.qsl.net/kd2bd/predict.html) binary on the back end (License: GPL).  That binary for 64 bit Ubuntu and the source tarball are also included.
