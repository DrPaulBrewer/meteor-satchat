meteor-satchat
==============

Meteor chat room app for ham radio satellite enthusiasts.

Beta version provides basic chat room and satellite location display.

This app is written in the [Meteor Javascript framework](http://www.meteor.com)

Contributions of code for features and patches are appreciated and will be mentioned in the CREDITS.

This meteor-satchat github repository contains both the front end code and a custom Meteor package to bridge to a back end copy of KD2BD predict, a well-establised Linux text-based satellite prediction program by John A. Magliacane, KD2BD.

Want to help out? test your own copy?

Instructions for setup on a [nitrous.io development VPS](https://www.nitrous.io/join/1gTLHmZbZMc?utm_source=nitrous.io&utm_medium=copypaste&utm_campaign=referral) to follow...

version 0.5.0 uses the [John Magliacane's KD2BD Predict](http://www.qsl.net/kd2bd/predict.html) binary on the back end (License: GPL).  That binary for 64 bit Ubuntu and the source tarball are also included.
